# SQL-Product-Hierarchy-Analysis

Hello everyone! üåü

Excited to unveil my latest project where I delved deep into analyzing product hierarchies using SQL! üíª This journey wasn't just about crunching numbers, but also about uncovering insights that can drive strategic decisions for Balanced Tree. üåø Let's dive into the details!

## Description:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the product hierarchy at Balanced Tree, focusing on categories, segments, and styles. Leveraging SQL's power, I extracted valuable insights into product sales, quantities, and revenue across different levels of the hierarchy.

## Key Achievements:

1. Employed SQL queries to dissect product hierarchies, revealing top-selling products and revenue distribution.

2. Analyzed transaction data to understand customer behavior and preferences at each level of the product hierarchy.

3. Generated actionable insights to optimize product offerings and marketing strategies.


## Technical Skills Applied:

1. SQL Querying

2. Data Aggregation and Analysis

3. Hierarchical Data Processing

4. Insights Generation
